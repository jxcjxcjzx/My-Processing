DESCRIPTION
=======================================================================

This library contains pure Java implementations of a number of well
known WordNet based similarity measures. It was developed as an
alternative to the popular perl WordNet::Similarity package and should
produce identical results. See the JavaDoc files for more information.

OBTAINING THE SOFTWARE
=======================================================================

This library is available by following the appropriate links from
    http://nlp.shef.ac.uk/result/software.html

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS
=======================================================================

Other than this library you will need to have installed a copy of
WordNet. I'd currently suggest installing v2.0 as Information Content
files which are required for some of the measures are available for
this version (see http://www.d.umn.edu/~tpederse/similarity.html).
Once WordNet is installed you will need to edit the wordnet.xml file
in the test directory to contain the correct install path before
testing the library, which can be done by running ant test from the
main directory of the library.
