SpeakRight Framework
====================

Requirements
------------
SpeakRight was created on Eclipse 3.2.1 which uses Java 1 (jre/jdk) 1.5.0.11 and Tomcat 5.5.

Installation
------------

Using the installer (Windows and Linux):

Simply unzip speakright-<version>.zip to extract the installer jar archive.
Become root on Linux machines.
Call
java -jar speakright-<version>-install.jar
to install the SpeakRight framework.

On Windows, a double-click on the jar should do it.


The installation folder is referred as SpeakRight_HOME

Run the Demos
-------------
Open org.speakright.core.tests.InteractiveTester and run it as a Java Application.  It uses the ITest utility that runs the 
SpeakRight callflow from the console.  Audio output is simply printed as text to the console, and speech recognition is 
simulated keyboard input.

Run the Unit Tests
------------------
SpeakRight uses Junit 4.1 and XMLUnit 1.0.  Run the tests in org.speakright.core.tests

Build a Servlet
---------------
A sample servlet is provided at demos/SampleServlet/src/org/speakright/demos/sampleservlet  

1. Make a WAR file for it (in Eclipse do Export / and choose WAR file).
2. Upload your servlet WAR file to a web server that hosts servlets.  Eclipse has a version of Tomcat, or you can install a stand-alone 
   tomcat.
3. First test you app using HTML.  Point your web browser at the url, adding "?mode=html" to get SpeakRight to serve up HTML. 
   For example, http://localhost:8081/SampleServlet/App1?mode=html
   You should see the first page of speech content rendered as HTML.  You can press the Submit button to go to the next page.
   
4. Test the app from a voicexml browser.  Point it to your servlet.  For example http://localhost:8081/SampleServlet/App1

You can test for free from the Voxeo site (http://www.voxeo.com/developers/), using
either a phone or Skype.
