SpeakRight Framework
====================

Requirements
------------
SpeakRight was created on Eclipse 3.2.1 which uses Java 1 (jre/jdk) 1.5.0.11 and Tomcat 5.5.

Windows Installation
--------------------
1. Take the zip file you downloaded (SpeakRight-src-v-x-x-x.zip) and extract it into a directory. I'll use
c:\source\speakright here, but you can use any directory.

2. Open ecplise and File / Switch WorkSpace to "c:\source\speakright".  This will create the workspace.

3. Import the project.  Do File / Import / Existing Project Into Workspace and choose c:\source\speakright\srf

4. Switch to J2EE perspective and view the Servers tab (bottom of screen).  Right-click and do New / Server.
 Select Apache Tomcat v5.5 and browse to its path, such as C:\eclipse\plugins\apache-tomcat-5.5.20

5. Try to run a unit test.  In project explorer, open srf and right-click on test. Select Run As / JUnit Test.
It will complain about no log4j properties.  So copy log4j.properties from c:\source\speakright into the bin
subdirectory of srf.

6. Now the unit tests should run.


Linux Installation
--------------------
I'm afraid you're on your own with this.  Please let me know what steps are needed to install SpeakRight
on Linux.


Run the Demos
-------------
Open org.speakright.demo.simpsons.InteractiveTester and run it as a Java Application.  It uses the ITest utility that runs the SimpsonsDemo app from the console.  Audio output is simply printed as text to the console, and speech recognition is 
simulated keyboard input.

Run the Unit Tests
------------------
SpeakRight uses Junit 4.1 and XMLUnit 1.0.  Run the tests in org.speakright.core.tests

Build a Servlet
---------------
A sample servlet is provided at demos/SampleServlet/src/org/speakright/demos/sampleservlet  

1. Make a WAR file for it (in Eclipse do Export / and choose WAR file).
2. Upload your servlet WAR file to a web server that hosts servlets.  Eclipse has a version of Tomcat, or you can install a stand-alone 
   tomcat.
3. First test you app using HTML.  Point your web browser at the url, adding "?mode=html" to get SpeakRight to serve up HTML. 
   For example, http://localhost:8081/SampleServlet/App1?mode=html
   You should see the first page of speech content rendered as HTML.  You can press the Submit button to go to the next page.
   
4. Test the app from a voicexml browser.  Point it to your servlet.  For example http://localhost:8081/SampleServlet/App1

You can test for free from the Voxeo site (http://www.voxeo.com/developers/), using
either a phone or Skype.
